Climate Change and Its Effects

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts can occur naturally over geological timescales; however, since the industrial revolution, human activities have significantly contributed to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and other processes.

Key Points:
- Global temperatures are rising.
- Weather patterns have become more erratic.
- Extreme events such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires are increasing in frequency.
